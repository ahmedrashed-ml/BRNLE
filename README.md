# BRNLE
This is an implementation of the BRNLE model that was proposed in the KDD2019 paper "Multi-Relational Classification via Bayesian Ranked Non-Linear Embeddings"

Note: Currently this implementation only contains the script for reproducing the Email dataset results. Further datasets will be added soon.
